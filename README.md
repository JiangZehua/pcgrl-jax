# PCGRL-jax

Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL), implemented end-to-end in JAX.

The level-generation environments, the PPO training loop and evaluation are all written in JAX, so thousands of
environments can run in parallel on one GPU. The codebase supports:

- **Single-agent PCGRL**: one generator agent edits a level, with `narrow`, `turtle`, `wide` and `nca` representations.
- **Multi-agent PCGRL**: several generator agents edit the same level at the same time (MAPPO-style training in `train_ma.py`).
- **Controllable generation**: you set target values for level metrics (e.g. path length, number of regions).
- **Generalization experiments**: you can vary the observation window, the map size and shape, the change percentage,
  the number of board scans and more, then cross-evaluate on out-of-distribution maps.

This repository contains the code for the two papers listed in [Citation](#citation).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then [install JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for your hardware, e.g. for CUDA 12:

```bash
pip install -U "jax[cuda12]"
```

`req312.txt` holds a fully pinned environment (Python 3.12, JAX 0.6) that we know works.

Logging uses [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai). Pass `wandb_mode=disabled` to turn it off.

## Quick start

All entry points are [Hydra](https://hydra.cc) apps, so you override any field of the dataclasses in
[`conf/config.py`](conf/config.py) from the command line:

```bash
# Single-agent: train a generator on the binary problem
python train.py problem=binary representation=narrow model=conv overwrite=True

# Multi-agent: 3 turtle agents sharing one map
python train_ma.py problem=binary n_agents=3 model=conv2 representation=turtle

# Render GIFs of a trained single-agent model (same args as used for training)
python enjoy.py problem=binary representation=narrow model=conv

# Evaluate a trained model
python eval.py problem=binary representation=narrow model=conv
python eval_ma.py problem=binary n_agents=3 model=conv2
```

Checkpoints, logs and renders go to `saves/<experiment-name>/`. The experiment name is derived from the config
(see `get_exp_dir` in [`utils.py`](utils.py)).

### Main options

| Option | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `problem` | `binary`, `maze`, `dungeon`, `dungeon2` | Level-design task; see [`envs/probs/`](envs/probs) |
| `representation` | `narrow`, `turtle`, `wide`, `nca` | How the agent edits the map; see [`envs/reps/`](envs/reps) |
| `model` | `conv`, `conv2`, `seqnca`, `rnn`, `dense`, `nca` | Policy architecture; see [`models.py`](models.py) |
| `map_width` | int (default `16`) | Size of the (square) map |
| `randomize_map_shape` | bool | Sample a random rectangular map shape every episode |
| `obs_size` / `arf_size` / `vrf_size` | int (`-1` = full map) | Observation window for the policy / action branch / value branch |
| `ctrl_metrics` | e.g. `[diameter,n_regions]` | Metrics whose targets the agent conditions on |
| `change_pct` | float (`-1` = off) | Maximum fraction of tiles the agent may change |
| `max_board_scans` | float | Episode length, measured in passes over the whole board |
| `n_agents` | int | Number of generator agents (multi-agent only) |
| `n_envs`, `total_timesteps`, `lr`, ... | | PPO hyperparameters |

## Experiment sweeps

Sweeps are grid searches defined as YAML files in [`conf/sweeps/`](conf/sweeps), e.g.
[`conf/sweeps/ma_board_scans_binary_aiide.yaml`](conf/sweeps/ma_board_scans_binary_aiide.yaml).
Each key lists the values to sweep over. `eval_hypers` lists extra settings to sweep over at evaluation time only.

```bash
# Train every config in a sweep (locally, one after another)
python sweep.py name=ma_board_scans_binary_aiide mode=train slurm=False

# Evaluate / render / plot the same sweep
python sweep.py name=ma_board_scans_binary_aiide mode=eval slurm=False
python sweep.py name=ma_board_scans_binary_aiide mode=enjoy slurm=False
python sweep.py name=ma_board_scans_binary_aiide mode=plot slurm=False

# Collect the results into tables and figures under cross_eval/
python cross_eval.py name=ma_board_scans_binary_aiide
```

`mode` is one of `train`, `eval`, `eval_cp` (evaluate over a range of change percentages), `enjoy`, `plot` or
`get_traces`. With `slurm=True` (the default), each config is submitted as a SLURM job through
[submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit). The SLURM account comes from `SLURM_ACCOUNT` in a `.env`
file.

If you leave out `name`, `sweep.py` uses the `hypers` defined in [`conf/config_sweeps.py`](conf/config_sweeps.py) and
writes them out to `conf/sweeps/` first.

Sweeps prefixed with `ma_` are the multi-agent experiments (AIIDE 2025). The others (`arf_*`, `obss_*`, `cp_*`,
`act_shape_*`, `diff_size_*`, ...) are the single-agent scaling and generalization experiments (CoG 2024).
